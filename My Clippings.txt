lung anomalies. 18 Gli2–/– mice have unilobar left and right lungs19 and GLi3–/– mice present with reductions in shape and size of pulmonary segmental branches. 20 Recent studies found that Gli2–/–;GLi3–/– double-knockout mice have a hypoplastic foregut that completely lacked Nkx2.1-positive respiratory progenitors. 21 In addition, Wnt2/2b transcripts were also lost or dramatically downregulated in these embryos. Signaling mediated by fbroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) and its receptor 2b (FGFR2b) is crucial for lung bud initiation. FGF10 belongs to an increasingly large and complex family of growth factors that signal through four cognate tyrosine kinases FGFRs. 1 FGF10 is a chemotactic and proliferation factor for lung endoderm that is expressed in the mesenchyme at the prospective sites of lung bud formation. 22 T-box transcription factors Tbx2, Tbx3, and Tbx4 are coexpressed with Fgf10 in the mesenchyme, which may positively regulate Fgf10 expression. 23,24 The essential role of FGF10 in lung bud initiation is highlighted by the fndings that deletion of Fgf10 gene results in lung agenesis in mice.25–27 Retinoic acid (RA) also plays a role in lung bud formation. RA is produced in the mesoderm and can act on mesoderm and adjacent endoderm.RA, acting via the RA receptor β (RARβ) in the mesoderm, regulates Fgf10 expression by integrating the Wnt and TGF-β pathways
